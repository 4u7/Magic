A Haskell implementation of the rules of Wizards of the Coast's Magic: The
Gathering.

Magic is a big game. This implementation targets only a specific part of it:
for now, only two-player games and only cards, rules, card types and abilities
avaialble and relevant in the Magic 2012 core set are targeted.

The code is currently far from finished and in very experimental state.
